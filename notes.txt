/Set up of our index.js, app.js and database.js files.

/After the connecting to our database successfully, we proceed to create our database  tables. (modelado de datos)

/The tables structure is created in our schemas, following the diagram example we need to connect our two tables as 
each project has many tasks and each task has many projects, we do that in our Project.js file.

/Now we will set up routes for our projects first creating a file in our routes folder, we set up our routes,
it means router.post, router.get, etc. Keep in mind after we create a route we have to create a controller.

/We set up our controllers for each one project and task, after we import the model from each schema
